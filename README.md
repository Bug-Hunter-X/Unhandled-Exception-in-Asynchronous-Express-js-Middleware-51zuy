# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Express.js Middleware

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in asynchronous request handling within Express.js middleware. The provided `bug.js` showcases a scenario where an unhandled exception can occur within an asynchronous operation, leading to unexpected behavior or silent failures.  The `bugSolution.js` provides a robust solution addressing this issue. 

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file uses `process.nextTick` to simulate an asynchronous operation.  If an exception occurs within the `process.nextTick` callback, it's not properly caught, potentially causing the application to crash silently or behave unpredictably.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a better approach. It uses a `try...catch` block to wrap the asynchronous operation, ensuring that any exceptions are caught and handled gracefully, preventing unexpected application behavior.
